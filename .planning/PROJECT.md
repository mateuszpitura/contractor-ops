# Contractor Ops

## What This Is

A B2B contractor operations platform for EU companies (Poland-first) with 5-50 contractors. Replaces the Excel + email + Slack + bank chaos with a single system covering the full contractor lifecycle: onboarding, contracts, invoices, approvals, payments, and offboarding. Built as a multi-tenant SaaS targeting software houses, agencies, and tech companies with 10-200 employees.

## Core Value

The invoice-to-payment flow must work end-to-end: a contractor's invoice arrives, gets matched to their contract, routed through approval, and batched for payment — with full audit trail and zero manual tracking in spreadsheets.

## Current State

**v1.0 MVP shipped 2026-03-23** — 214K LOC TypeScript, 11 phases, 51 plans, 698 files.

All 14 product modules delivered: org setup, RBAC, contractors, contracts, documents, workflows, invoices (upload + email intake), approvals, notifications (in-app + email + Slack), payments, dashboard, reports, data import, onboarding wizard, global search + Cmd+K. Full Polish + English i18n.

### Active

- [ ] Contractor self-service portal with contract viewing, invoice submission, payment tracking, document upload, profile management
- [ ] Time tracking integration (Clockify, Jira, manual reporting) in contractor portal
- [ ] E-sign integration (DocuSign + Autenti) for contracts and NDAs
- [ ] OCR invoice parsing — auto-extract fields from uploaded PDFs
- [ ] KSeF native integration — pull invoices from national system + validate format compliance
- [ ] Jira integration — create tickets, update statuses, configurable automation on status changes
- [ ] Notion/Confluence integration — link onboarding docs, reference external documentation in workflows
- [ ] Outlook/Google Calendar integration — reminders, meeting scheduling, deadline sync, onboarding meetings (configurable)

### Out of Scope

- Payroll for employees — not an HR tool, contractor ops only
- EOR/AOR — local contractors only, not employer of record
- Performance reviews / recruiting / ATS — not HR
- Open banking / payment initiation — v3+
- SSO/SCIM — v3
- KSeF invoice validation against structured data — v3
- Contractor marketplace / directory — never
- Full accounting suite — coordination layer, not replacement
- Mobile native app — desktop-first, responsive to tablet, approval flow works on mobile browser

## Current Milestone: v2.0 Platform Expansion

**Goal:** Transform Contractor Ops from an internal-only tool into a full platform with contractor self-service, intelligent document processing, KSeF compliance, and deep third-party integrations.

**Target features:**
- Contractor portal (self-service with time tracking)
- E-sign (DocuSign + Autenti)
- OCR invoice parsing
- KSeF native integration
- Jira, Notion/Confluence, Outlook/Google Calendar integrations

## Context

**Market timing:** KSeF (Polish national e-invoice system) launched Feb 1, 2026 for large companies, April 1, 2026 for all. Every company with B2B contractors now needs structured invoice intake, matching, and approval — and most still do it in Excel + email.

**Target customer:** Polish tech companies (software houses, agencies, product companies, startups) with 10-200 people and 5-50 active B2B contractors. Buyer persona: COO, Head of Ops, Finance Manager, or Founder doing ops themselves.

**Pricing target:** 350-650 PLN/mo platform fee, optional per-contractor add-on. Path to 10K MRR: 70-130 customers.

**Competitive positioning:** Not "mini-Deel" (they're cross-border EOR at $29-49/contractor). Not Faktura.pl (invoice-first, no contractor lifecycle). Not Notion/Excel (no execution layer or audit trail). Contractor Ops is a narrow, deep, execution-grade system for local B2B contractor lifecycle.

**Existing artifacts:** Comprehensive PRD (prd.md) with UI views, API contracts, data model, security requirements, and gap analysis. Detailed database schema (db-schema.md) with PostgreSQL + Prisma, multi-tenant design, bounded contexts.

## Constraints

- **Monorepo:** Turborepo — apps and packages with clean boundaries
- **Frontend:** Next.js + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **State:** TanStack Query (server) + Zustand (client)
- **Tables:** TanStack Table
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Backend:** Node.js + TypeScript, tRPC for API layer
- **ORM:** Prisma with PostgreSQL
- **Auth:** Better Auth (managed, self-hosted)
- **Database:** Neon (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Cache/Queue:** Redis (Upstash on Vercel)
- **Storage:** S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2) for files
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Multi-tenant:** All queries scoped to organization_id via AsyncLocalStorage + Prisma extension
- **Desktop-first:** Responsive down to tablet (1024px), approval flow works on mobile browser
- **i18n:** Polish + English from day 1
- **Quality:** Production-grade code, WCAG AA, strong typing, schema validation at boundaries, security best practices (see CLAUDE.md)
- **Solo developer:** Building with AI assistance — phases should be self-contained and shippable

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| tRPC over REST | Full-stack type safety in Turborepo monorepo, better DX for solo dev | ✓ Good — 19 routers, zero API contract drift |
| Better Auth over Clerk | Open-source, self-hosted, flexible — avoids vendor lock-in for auth | ✓ Good — org plugin + RBAC works well |
| Neon over Supabase | Serverless Postgres with branching, great Vercel integration | ✓ Good — zero ops overhead |
| Next.js over Vite SPA | SSR/SSG, Vercel-native, file-based routing suits B2B dashboard | ✓ Good — locale routing, API routes for webhooks |
| Prisma over Drizzle | Mature ecosystem, great DX, schema designed with Prisma in mind | ✓ Good — multi-file schema, client extensions for tenant/soft-delete |
| Integer grosze for money | Eliminates floating-point precision risk | ✓ Good — consistent across all 11 phases |
| Email/upload for invoices v1 | KSeF deferred to v1.5 — ship simpler intake first | ✓ Good — validates flow without KSeF complexity |
| No contractor portal v1 | Internal-facing only — self-service deferred to v1.5 | ✓ Good — focused scope |
| cmdk for command palette | Already installed, lightweight, accessible | ✓ Good — zero config, works with tRPC search |
| xlsx for import/export | Single library for both directions | ✓ Good — BOM handling for Polish characters |
| Recharts for dashboard | Simple API, responsive, works with SSR | ✓ Good — area/bar/pie charts all working |

## Evolution

This document evolves at phase transitions and milestone boundaries.

**After each phase transition** (via `/gsd:transition`):
1. Requirements invalidated? → Move to Out of Scope with reason
2. Requirements validated? → Move to Validated with phase reference
3. New requirements emerged? → Add to Active
4. Decisions to log? → Add to Key Decisions
5. "What This Is" still accurate? → Update if drifted

**After each milestone** (via `/gsd:complete-milestone`):
1. Full review of all sections
2. Core Value check — still the right priority?
3. Audit Out of Scope — reasons still valid?
4. Update Context with current state
