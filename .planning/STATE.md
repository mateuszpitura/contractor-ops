# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** The invoice-to-payment flow must work end-to-end: invoice arrives, gets matched to contract, routed through approval, and batched for payment — with full audit trail.
**Current focus:** Phase 12 — integration-foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 12 (integration-foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 5

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 51 (v1.0) | 0 (v2.0)
- v1.0 delivered 51 plans across 11 phases in 6 days

**By Phase (v2.0):**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 12. Integration Foundation | TBD | - | - |

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 12 P01 | 4min | 2 tasks | 14 files |
| Phase 12 P03 | 4min | 2 tasks | 8 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0]: All v2 development on dedicated `v2` git branch
- [v2.0]: Portal is route group in apps/web, not separate app — shares auth, DB, tRPC, UI
- [v2.0]: Contractors use PortalSession model, never added to internal user table
- [v2.0]: Shared credential store + webhook layer before any specific integration
- [v2.0]: OCR before KSeF to establish async invoice pipeline pattern
- [Phase 12]: Per-provider encryption keys via ${SLUG_UPPER}_ENCRYPTION_KEY env var pattern
- [Phase 12]: Use adapter clientSecretEnvVar for OAuth state signing (not separate secret)
- [Phase 12]: Proactive+lazy dual token refresh: 30min lookahead cron + lazy fallback before API calls

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Prisma 7 prisma.config.ts fails to parse on Node 24.11.0 — using --schema flag workaround
- KSeF April 1 2026 mandatory deadline — Phase 17 must not slip
- Autenti QES vs standard signature routing needs legal/business input before Phase 15
- KSeF @ksef/client single-maintainer risk — validate library health at Phase 17 planning
