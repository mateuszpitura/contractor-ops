# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-18)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 10-phase fine-granularity roadmap derived from 89 requirements across 16 categories
- [Roadmap]: Workflow engine (Phase 4) and invoice pipeline (Phase 5) separated due to complexity and independent dependency chains
- [Roadmap]: Notifications and Slack integration as standalone Phase 7 — cross-cutting concern that depends on approval workflow being complete

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flags Phase 4 (Workflow Engine) and Phase 6 (Approval Workflow) as needing deeper technical design before implementation
- Integer-grosze vs Decimal decision must be made during Phase 1 database schema design
