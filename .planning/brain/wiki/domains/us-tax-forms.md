# US tax forms (W-9 / W-8BEN / W-8BEN-E) and treaty engine

## Purpose

Capture (not yet file) a US contractor's tax classification and resolve the correct
treaty article + rate. The contractor self-certifies a W-9 (US persons), W-8BEN
(foreign individuals), or W-8BEN-E (foreign entities) in the portal; staff get a
read/track-only mirror. The actual 1099/1042-S filing + pixel-accurate IRS PDFs are
deferred to later phases — this domain stops at an immutable signed self-certification
plus a resolved treaty claim.

The whole surface is dark behind `module.us-expansion` (default false; dev bypass
`FLAG_SIGNOFF_BYPASS=local` / `QA_DEFAULT_ORG_ID`).

## Flow

```
profile (countryCode + type)
  → getTaxFormDetermination  (routes W-9 / W-8BEN / W-8BEN-E + auto-populates treaty)
  → portal wizard: determination (confirm/override) → form step → attestation → receipt
  → submitTaxForm  (resolve treaty → build signed snapshot → supersede prior ACTIVE → audit)
  → staff status card reads taxForm.listFormSubmissions (status/treaty/expiry only)
```

Form routing (`determineFormType`): `countryCode === 'US'` → W-9; foreign COMPANY →
W-8BEN-E; foreign individual / sole-trader → W-8BEN. The determination is advisory;
the contractor can override on the first step.

Treaty resolution (`applyTreaty` / `resolveTreatyDecision`, mirrors reverse-charge):
auto-detect from (residency, US source, business-profits) against the shared
`WithholdingTaxRate` table, default 30% statutory when no treaty row, manual override
needs a reason + `writeAuditLog`. PL/DE/GB/IE/NL reduce to 0% under Article 7; AE/SA
have no US treaty (30%).

## IRS TIN-Matching

A recipient's name/TIN is validated against IRS records at W-9 intake and re-validated for the
whole batch at year-end, before 1099 generation. The check runs through a `TinMatchClient`
adapter seam: a deterministic `MockTinMatchClient` is the shipped default; the live
`EServicesTinMatchClient` sits behind the seam, dark, until PAF (Payer Account File) enrollment
+ e-Services registration clears — a separate operational prerequisite from the IRIS A2A TCC.
The live client pins its base URL to one of two compile-time literals selected by the
credential `environment` (SSRF-safe, mirroring `peppol-adapter-factory`) and refuses to
transmit while ungated.

`tin-match.service` owns the policy: a 24h result cache (keyed on org+recipient+name+TIN-last4,
never a full TIN), a bounded retry on transient client failures, and the mismatch handler. A
non-zero IRS numerical response indicator is **advisory, never a hard block** — it sets the
recipient backup-withholding flag, raises an admin escalation, and writes an audit row, then
returns a result; the 1099 still generates with the TIN as captured. The flag-set + escalation
writers are caller-supplied (the year-end batch / staff router against the applied schema); the
audit row is written here through `writeAuditLog`. The actual 24% payout reduction is a later
phase — this surface only records the flag.

## 1099-NEC generation

`form-1099-nec.service` is the deterministic year-end generation engine (published-threshold
arithmetic, not a classification verdict). `aggregateBox1` sums box-1 nonemployee compensation
by payment (settlement) date within the calendar tax year, **per recipient per payer-org**;
`aggregateBox1Async` FX-converts any non-USD payout to USD at the **payment-date rate** through
the in-tree `exchange-rate` service (one HALF-UP round on the integer minor-unit product — no
float drift). A non-USD payout that reaches the synchronous reducer without a pre-converted USD
amount throws rather than silently understating the box.

Generation is gated by the **tax-year-keyed `Tax1099Threshold` table** (`getBox1ThresholdMinor`),
never a constant: $600 TY2025, $2,000 TY2026 (OBBBA), inflation-indexed thereafter. `computeBox4Minor`
records federal backup withholding when the recipient's W-9 backup-withholding flag is set or a
TIN mismatch exists (the amount withheld; the 24% reduction is a later phase). `buildForm1099NecSnapshot`
builds the immutable record-of-record with the recipient TIN **last-4 only** (a sanitizer mirroring
`tax-form.service` strips any forged full-SSN/TIN key) plus an adviser-verify note.

A CORRECTED filing **supersedes, never mutates**: `supersedeCorrected` / `fileCorrection` flip the
prior ACTIVE row for `(organizationId, payerOrgId, recipientId, taxYear)` to SUPERSEDED then insert
a new ACTIVE row with `corrected: true` inside one `$transaction`; the filed row is never updated.
`generateBatch` is wrapped in `idempotency.reserve/complete/clear` so a retried batch returns the
prior result instead of re-filing, and writes an audit row on generation. The persistence sink is an
injected port — the deterministic core is unit-tested with no live database; the schema-applied
router/wiring caller supplies the real writer.

The recipient **Copy-B PDF** (`form-1099-nec-pdf` → `Form1099NecCopyBDocument`) is a substitute
black-ink form per Pub 1179 §4.6, rendered via a lazy `import('@react-pdf/renderer')` `renderToBuffer`
from the **stored immutable snapshot** (values as filed, never a live recompute), showing the recipient
TIN masked to last-4 only and carrying the adviser-verify footnote. It is archived to the US R2 tax
bucket under `1099-nec/<orgId>/<id>.pdf`; a `pdfArchiveKey` compare-and-swap prevents a double render.
Copy B ONLY — the IRS Copy A goes via the IRIS XML e-file, never a rendered PDF.

## IRIS XML e-file

The IRS Copy A is transmitted as IRIS (Information Returns Intake System) XML, not a
PDF, by the dedicated [[structure/packages|`@contractor-ops/iris`]] package.
`buildIrisXml` assembles the 1099-NEC submission with a fast-xml-parser `XMLBuilder`
(never string-concatenated XML, mirroring `packages/einvoice`): the Transmission
Manifest carries the schema `VersionNum`/`VersionDt` the payload was built against
(payload-manifest, re-verified per tax year — not message metadata), each payee
B-record carries its Combined Federal/State Filing (CFSF) state code, and amounts emit
as IRIS USAmountType whole dollars. The recipient TIN is emitted **masked (last-4 only**,
e.g. `XXX-XX-1120`) — the full recipient SSN/TIN is never reconstructed or passed in,
mirroring the snapshot sanitizer. `xsdValidate` round-trips the XML against the bundled
IRS IRIS XSD with `libxmljs2` and returns `{ status: 'VALID' | 'INVALID', errors }`
(the einvoice KoSIT layer-1 report shape); it is SSRF/XXE-safe (`parseXml({ nonet: true })`
blocks an external `<xs:import schemaLocation="http://…">`, default `noent: false` keeps
external-entity expansion off).

The IRS IRIS XSDs are a **human-action checkpoint**: a human-only download (IRS SOR
login — not public, not on npm), placed under `packages/iris/src/schema-bundle/` with the
SHA-256 of each file pinned in `checksums.txt` (guarded by
`pnpm --filter @contractor-ops/iris verify:schema-checksums`). The generator works fully
today; until the XSDs are placed, `xsdValidate` reports `XSD-BUNDLE-MISSING` (INVALID)
rather than throwing, so the validator's VALID path stays blocked on the human download.

## UI surface

- Portal wizard: `apps/web-vite/src/components/portal/tax-forms/` — `tax-form-wizard.tsx`
  (container: reui Stepper + AnimateIn + loading/empty/error), `hooks/use-tax-form-wizard.ts`
  (sole tRPC/RHF boundary), `step-determination` / `step-w9` / `step-w8ben` / `step-w8ben-e`
  / `step-attest` / `step-receipt`, route `portal/tax-form`.
- Staff status card: `apps/web-vite/src/components/contractors/tax-forms/tax-form-status-card.tsx`
  + `hooks/use-tax-form-status.ts` — status pill (ACTIVE/DRAFT/SUPERSEDED/expiring) reusing the
  `UspsAddressStatusPill` idiom; full SSN behind `SsnMaskedReveal` (`contractorPii:read`).

## Invariants

- Append-only: `submitTaxForm` supersedes the prior ACTIVE row then inserts the new ACTIVE
  row in one `$transaction`; signed rows are never mutated, only DRAFT rows are.
- ESIGN attestation (ip / actorId / signedAt) is 100% server-derived from the portal
  session + headers — the client schema omits all three; identity cannot be forged.
- The W-9 payload never carries a full SSN — only the last-4 reference (the SSN lives in
  its encrypted column with the `contractorPii:read` reveal gate). `buildFormSnapshot`
  recursively strips full-SSN/TIN keys as a second guard.
- IDOR: every portal read/write is scoped to `ctx.contractorId` + `ctx.organizationId`,
  never a client-supplied id.
- Staff cannot sign on behalf — `requestTaxForm` only writes an audit event.
- Treaty rows live in the shared `WithholdingTaxRate` table (`sourceCountry='US'`,
  `treatyArticle` column); the same table feeds Phase 87's 1042-S withholding.
- A TIN mismatch is advisory only — it sets the backup-withholding flag + escalates, and the
  1099 still generates. The TIN-match service never throws on a mismatch and never blocks the
  year-end loop. A full TIN/SSN never reaches a log line, the cache key, or the audit metadata.
- The 1099-NEC threshold is read from the tax-year-keyed `Tax1099Threshold` table, never a
  constant ($600 TY2025 / $2,000 TY2026 OBBBA). Box-1 is aggregated by payment-date and
  FX-converted to USD at the payment-date rate, per recipient per payer-org.
- A CORRECTED 1099 supersedes (prior ACTIVE → SUPERSEDED, new ACTIVE with `corrected: true`,
  one `$transaction`); a filed `Form1099Nec` row is never updated. `generateBatch` is idempotent
  so a retried batch never double-files. The Copy-B PDF renders from the immutable snapshot
  (last-4 TIN only) — Copy B only, never IRS Copy A.
- IRIS Copy A is XML, never a PDF: `buildIrisXml` builds it with a real XML builder (never
  string concatenation), emits the recipient TIN masked to last-4 only, and stamps the schema
  `VersionNum`/`VersionDt` from the payload manifest. `xsdValidate` is SSRF/XXE-safe and returns
  `XSD-BUNDLE-MISSING` (INVALID, never throws) until the human-only IRS IRIS XSDs are placed and
  checksum-verified under `packages/iris/src/schema-bundle/`.

## Agent mistakes

- Do NOT add a full-SSN field to the wizard or snapshot — reuse the encrypted column.
- Do NOT extend the always-mounted `taxRouter` for the staff surface — the dedicated
  `taxForm` router is what `root.ts` conditionally spreads behind `module.us-expansion`.
- Do NOT add tRPC outside `hooks/use-*.ts` (web-vite layering, `check:web-vite-data-layer`).
- Do NOT add a 5th field to the `WithholdingTaxRate` `@@unique` key — it breaks the seed
  upsert + `calculateWht` lookup.
- The treaty claim is advisory display; the authoritative resolution + persistence happen
  server-side.
- Do NOT call `EServicesTinMatchClient` on the default path — it is dark behind a PAF/flag gate;
  the shipped default is `MockTinMatchClient`. Do NOT hard-block on a TIN mismatch.
- Do NOT embed the 1099 threshold as a constant — read `Tax1099Threshold` by tax year. Do NOT
  render IRS Copy A as a PDF (Copy B only; Copy A goes via IRIS XML). Do NOT recompute figures in
  the PDF — render from the immutable snapshot. Do NOT mutate a filed `Form1099Nec` — correct by
  superseding.
- Do NOT pass a full SSN/TIN into `buildIrisXml` — the payee TIN is the masked last-4 value. Do
  NOT string-concatenate IRIS XML — use the `@contractor-ops/iris` builder. Do NOT treat an
  `XSD-BUNDLE-MISSING` report as a code bug — the IRS IRIS XSDs are a human-only download placed at
  the `src/schema-bundle/` checkpoint.
